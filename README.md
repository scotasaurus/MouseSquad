# Mouse Squad Python Repository

Congratulations! You've found the Mouse Squad python respository. If you're working on Module 2, you'll find the relevant portions of the assignment in the "module 2" folder.

The module 2 folder includes the MouseIntro.py file, which exposes a class that has three methods:

* printHelloWorld(), which prints a simple "Hello World" statement.
* printSum(value1, value2), which prints the addition of the two supplied numbers.
* multiplyValues(value1, value2), which returns the product of the two values.

## Steps to Leverage Github Code

To leverage this, you'll need to copy the python file to your local machine. 
1. In Github, open the "module 2" folder
2. Download the "MouseIntro.py" file to your local machine.
3. Upload the file to your pythonanywhere.com account.
4. Import the file into your console or python file using the import command ("import MouseIntro")

## Sample Consumption Code

Were you successful in getting the imported code to run in your environment? Sample code below.

import MouseIntro

test = MouseIntro()

test.printHelloWorld()

test.printSum(10, 20)

x = test.multiplyValues(5, 4)

print x
